  title: Suspicious Invocation of Shell via Rsync
sigma_fields: true
description: 'Detects the execution of a shell as sub process of "rsync" without the
  expected command line flag "-e" being used, which could be an indication of exploitation
  as described in CVE-2024-12084. This behavior is commonly associated with attempts
  to execute arbitrary commands or escalate privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized
  access or further exploitation.
