  title: Audit Rules Deleted Via Auditctl
sigma_fields: true
description: 'Detects the execution of ''auditctl'' with the ''-D'' command line parameter,
  which deletes all configured audit rules and watches on Linux systems.

  This technique is commonly used by attackers to disable audit logging and cover
  their tracks by removing monitoring capabilities.

  Removal of audit rules can significantly impair detection of malicious activities
  on the affected system.
