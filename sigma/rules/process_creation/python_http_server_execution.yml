description: 'Detects the execution of Python web servers via command line interface
  (CLI).

  After gaining access to target systems, adversaries may use Python''s built-in HTTP
  server modules to quickly establish a web server without requiring additional software.

  This technique is commonly used in post-exploitation scenarios as it provides a
  simple method for transferring files between the compromised host and attacker-controlled
  systems.
