  title: Potential PHP Reverse Shell
sigma_fields: true
description: 'Detects usage of the PHP CLI with the "-r" flag which allows it to run
  inline PHP code. The rule looks for calls to the "fsockopen" function which allows
  the creation of sockets.

  Attackers often leverage this in combination with functions such as "exec" or "fopen"
  to initiate a reverse shell connection.
