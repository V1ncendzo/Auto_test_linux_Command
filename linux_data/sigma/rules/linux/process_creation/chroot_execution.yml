  title: Linux Sudo Chroot Execution
sigma_fields: true
description: 'Detects the execution of ''sudo'' command with ''--chroot'' option,
  which is used to change the root directory for command execution.

  Attackers may use this technique to evade detection and execute commands in a modified
  environment.

  This can be part of a privilege escalation strategy, as it allows the execution
  of commands with elevated privileges in a controlled environment as seen in CVE-2025-32463.

  While investigating, look out for unusual or unexpected use of ''sudo --chroot''
  in conjunction with other commands or scripts such as execution from temporary directories
  or unusual user accounts.
